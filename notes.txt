WHEN USING TRUFFLE CONSOLE TO MANIPULATE CONTRACTS

ERROR : "Invalid number of arguments to Solidity function", etc.

EX: Make sure you attach a console inside the
directory instead of globally.

ON GITHUB :

"Guys, Delete your build folder, then run the command.

npm run truffle migrate --reset --compile-all
I find it works best when running truffle locally to the folder rather than globally, due to the beta and different versions getting updated quickly recently.
if you prefer the global approach try

truffle migrate --reset --compile-all"
